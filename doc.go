/*

Package klo is a "kubectl-like outputter" that prints Go values, such as
structs, maps, et cetera, in several output formats, very similar to what
"kubectl -o" has to offer. In particular, it offers ASCII table formatting
with custom columns including column headers and self-adjusting column widths.
